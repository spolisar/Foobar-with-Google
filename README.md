# Foobar-with-Google
Foobar with Google is a easter egg/hiring program that google uses to test and hire software engineers.

I got an invite to foobar with google while doing some googling. I got my invite in a private window which is a bit weird, but let's ignore my weird habit of googling tech/programming stuff in private windows.

I'm using this repo to keep copies of the code I write for each of the tasks.
